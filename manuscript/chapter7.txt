## Patterns of Dynamics: Summaries

**Co-Evolution**: *A design situation and designer’s understanding of the design situation changes and evolves in parallel and under influence of design outcome and designer’s understating of potential design outcomes.*

**A Solution Looking for a Problem**: *Understanding of a design outcome and its possibilities leads to usages of the same design in situations and for problems that were not initially envisioned.*

**A Problematic Solution**: *The consequences of a design outcome create new situations that are perceived as problematic and may ask for another design to improve it. A design may become more known for the problems it caused than for the solution it provided.*

**Boomerang**: *Designer’s efforts to address some situation triggers a number of reactions that radically change the original design situation often to the point that the intended design outcome or a contribution of a designer becomes unsuccessful, obsolete or irrelevant. Such reactions would normally not occur without the design activity.*.

**Puzzle Solving**: *A design situation is viewed as a clearly defined and static problem (i.e. a problem that can be clearly stated and where it is known what form the solution should have). A design outcome is seen as a solution for this problem. Design is viewed as a problem-solving activity.*

**Resource Signature**: *Possibilities and constraints of design resources are leaving a typical signature on a design outcome. It is often possible to guess, from the design outcome, which design resources were used.*

**Outcome Signature**: *Design resources are adapted to a design outcome, sometimes to the point that the form and organization of design resources reflects in many aspects the intended shape of the outcome.*

**Design-by-Buzzword**: *A designer is joining a growing trend in using some technology, often in an opportunist way. New opportunities of particular design resources are shaping the design outcome.*

**Resource Conformity**: *Design resources are used in a design situation out conformity, because such resources are popular or have often been used in similar situations. This usage of design resources further contributes to popularity of a tool and its usage in similar design situations.*

**Resource Commitment**: *In a new design situation designers use tools they committed to beforehand.*

**Cherry Picking****Motto**: *Design situations are selected based on how easily they can be approached with preferred or available resources. Other situations are avoided.*



## Patterns of Dynamics: Mottos

**Co-Evolution**: *“If you want to change something, you need to understand it, if you want to understand something you need to change it.”*

**A Solution Looking for a Problem**: *“When humans possess a tool, they excel at finding new uses for it”*

**A Problematic Solution**: *“Everything we design has the potential not only to solve problems but also to create new ones”*.

**Boomerang**: "*How can something seem so plausible at the time and so idiotic in retrospect?*"

**Puzzle Solving**: "*A problem well put is half solved.*"

**Resource Signature**: "*Every contact leaves a trace.*"

**Outcome Signature**: "*We are what we repeatedly do.*"

**Design-by-Buzzword**: "*Projects that do not capitalize on new opportunities will generally find their products unable to compete.*"

**Resource Conformity**: "*When in Rome, do as the Roman's do.*", "*Don't reinvent the wheel.*".

**Resource Commitment**: *“It is a poor craftsman that blames his tools.”*

**Cherry Picking**: *"Do one thing and do it well."*
