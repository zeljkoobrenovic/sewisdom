# Foreword

This book contains a selection of 1000 quotes from [IEEE Software](https://publications.computer.org/software-magazine/). IEEE Software is a leading software engineering magazine with a very rich history. Since 1984, many of the leading software engineering professionals have contributed to IEEE Software. The list includes Grady Booch, Bjarne Stroustrup, Martin Fowler, Fred Brooks, David Parnas, Tom DeMarco, Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham Victor Basili, C.A.R. Hoare, Watts Humphrey, Ivar Jacobson, Stephen J. Mellor, Bertrand Meyer, Winston W. Royce, James Rumbaugh, Niklaus Wirth, Mohamed Fayad, and many others.

The content is based on the material from the [IEEE Software history website](<https://obren.info/ieeesw>). Visit this site to find more details about IEEE Software and its history.

Selected quotes are not intended to serve as a comprehensive overview of the history of software engineering. Rather, the book is designed as a "coffee table book". It is intended for casual reading, offering interesting, educative, thought-provoking, and sometimes controversial quotes.


I hope you will enjoy reading the book!
