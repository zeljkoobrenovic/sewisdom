# Foreword

This book contains a selection of 1000 quotes from [IEEE Software](https://publications.computer.org/software-magazine/). IEEE Software has a very rich history. Since 1984, many of the leading software engineering professionals have contributed to IEEE Software. The list includes Grady Booch, Bjarne Stroustrup, Martin Fowler, Fred Brooks, David Parnas, Tom DeMarco, Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham Victor Basili, C.A.R. Hoare, Watts Humphrey, Ivar Jacobson, Stephen J. Mellor, Bertrand Meyer, Winston W. Royce, James Rumbaugh, Niklaus Wirth, Mohamed Fayad, and many others.

The content is based on the material from the [IEEE Software history website](<https://obren.info/ieeesw>). On this site, you may find a full list of IEEE Software issues and articles.

Selected quotes are not intended to server as a comprehensive overview of the history of software engineering and IEEE Software. Rather, the book is more of a "coffee table book", intended for casual reading, and offering interesting, educative, thought-provoking, and sometimes controversial quotes.
