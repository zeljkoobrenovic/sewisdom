## A. Patterns of Dynamics: Summaries


**Co-Evolution of Problem-Solution {#CoEvolution}**: *A design situation and designer’s understanding of the design situation (problem definition) changes and evolves in parallel and under the influence of design outcome and designer’s understating of potential design outcomes (design solutions).*

**Solution Looking for a Problem {#SolutionLookingForProblem}**: *Understanding of a design outcome and its possibilities leads to innovative usages of the  design outcome in situations and for problems that were not initially envisioned.*

**Problematic Solution {#ProblematicSolution}**: *The consequences of a design outcome create new situations that are perceived as problematic and may ask for another design to improve it. A design outcome may become more known for the problems it caused than for the solution it provided.*

**The Force Awakens {#Boomerang}**: *Designer’s efforts to address some situation triggers reactions that radically change the original design situation. Often such reactions make the intended design outcome or a contribution of a designer obsolete or irrelevant. Such responses would typically not occur without the design activity.*

**Puzzle Solving {#PuzzleSolving}**: *A design situation is viewed as a clearly defined and static problem (i.e., a problem that can be clearly stated and where it is known what form the solution should have). A design outcome is seen as a solution for this problem. Design is viewed as a problem-solving activity.*

**Resource Signature {#ResourceSignature}**: *Design resources, as well as the way how working with these resources is organized, are leaving a characteristic signature on a design outcome. It is often possible to guess, from the design outcome, which design resources were used, and how the working with the resources was organized.*

**Outcome Signature {#OutcomeSignature}**: *Design resources are adapted to a design outcome, sometimes to the point that the form and organization of design resources reflects the intended shape of the outcome.*

**Design-by-Buzzword {#DesignByBuzzword}**: *A designer is joining a growing trend in using some technology, often in an opportunist way. New opportunities of design resources are shaping the design outcome.*

**Resource Conformity {#ResourceConformity}**: *To minimize risks in a new design situation, designers use popular and proven resources with established best practices. Such conformity may be driven by positive experiences of others in similar situations, mere popularity of design resources, or mandatory requirements. The usage of a design resource further contributes to establishment and popularity of the resource and its usage in new design situations.*

**Resource Commitment {#ResourceCommitment}**: *In a new design situation designers use tools they committed to beforehand.*

**Cherry Picking {#CherryPicking}**: *Design situations are selected based on how quickly they can be approached with preferred or available resources. Other situations are avoided.*



## B. Patterns of Dynamics: Mottos

**Co-Evolution of Problem-Solution {#CoEvolution}**: *“If you want to change something, you need to understand it, if you want to understand something you need to change it.” ([Gravemeijer and Cobb 2006](#Gravemeijer2006))*

**Solution Looking for a Problem {#SolutionLookingForProblem}**: *“When humans possess a tool, they excel at finding new uses for it.” ([Nye 2006](#Nye2006))*

**Problematic Solution {#ProblematicSolution}**: *“Everything we design has the potential not only to solve problems but also to create new ones.” ([Lawson 2005](#Lawson2005))*

**The Force Awakens {#Boomerang}**: *"How can something seem so plausible at the time and so idiotic in retrospect?" (Bill Watterson, Calvin and Hobbes)*

**Puzzle Solving {#PuzzleSolving}**: *"A problem well put is half solved." (John Dewey, The Pattern of Inquiry)*

**Resource Signature {#ResourceSignature}**: *"Every contact leaves a trace." (Edmond Locard)*

**Outcome Signature {#OutcomeSignature}**: *"We are what we repeatedly do." (Will Durant, The Story of Philosophy)*

**Design-by-Buzzword {#DesignByBuzzword}**: *"Projects that do not capitalize on new opportunities will generally find their products unable to compete." [Boehm and Bhuta (2008)](#Boehm2008)*

**Resource Conformity {#ResourceConformity}**: *"When in Rome, do as the Roman's do."*

**Resource Commitment {#ResourceCommitment}**: *“It is a poor craftsman that blames his tools.”*

**Cherry Picking {#CherryPicking}**: *"Do one thing and do it well."*



## C. Sources of Dynamics: Summaries

**The Moving Target Problem**: *Design situations, resources, and outcomes change more rapidly than designers’ understanding of them. Consequently, designers need to work without having significant experience with, and understanding of, design situations, resources, and outcomes. Waiting to obtain more experience and better understanding is risky as the issues may quickly become less important or obsolete.*

**Increasing Interconnectivity**: *Design situations, design outcome, and design resources are increasingly more globally interconnected. Increasing interconnectivity means that there are more ways or channels through which a design activity may be influenced.*

**Learning and Creativity**: *Behaviors and expectations of people are constantly changing due to their learning and creativity.*

**Tacit Knowledge and Skills**: *Designers are relying on tacit knowledge and skills that they do not fully understand and cannot fully explain. Because of its implicit nature, it is hard to predict what effects tacit knowledge will have in design.*

**Social Dynamics**: *Design situations, resources, and outcomes are complex socio-technical systems, with complex, difficult to predict dynamics.*

**Lack of Strong Principles, Theories, and Laws**: *Designers are dealing with poorly understood phenomena, for which we do not have strong underlying principles, theories, and laws.*
