# Part III: Sources of Dynamics

Dynamics of design activities are caused and influences by diverse factors. Designers have to make decisions in a limited time based on the imperfect information they have. They are working in situations that are constantly changing due to forces beyond their control. Designers are using and relying on knowledge and skills that they do not fully understand and cannot explain. And at the same time, they do not have any strong underlying principles, theories, and laws to guide them.

In this part, we discuss our view on the main reasons behind instability of design activities and occurrence of patterns of dynamics between design situations, design outcomes and design resources. We address the following topics:

* The moving target problem,
* Increasing interconnectivity,
* Learning and creativity,
* Reliance on tacit knowledge and skills,
* Social dynamics, and
* Lack of strong theories and principles.

Our primary goal is to provide an initial categorization of sources of design dynamics and to relate them to the patterns from the previous chapter. Our overview of sources of design instability is not intended to be complete, but rather a starting point and the proposed classification is not a clear-cut.


## A. The Moving Target Problem

**Summary**: *Design situations, resources, and outcomes change more rapidly than designers’ understanding of them. Consequently, designers need to work without having significant experience with, and understanding of, design situations, resources, and outcomes. Waiting to obtain more knowledge and better understanding is risky as the issues may quickly become less relevant or obsolete.*

The world surrounding a design activity is continuously changing. New materials, devices, computers and software products are continuously appearing, introducing new opportunities. Because these changes may happen rapidly, designers have limited time to create a useful design outcome. Design outcomes, especially those involving computing technologies[^footnote1], have a limited lifespan, and may quickly become irrelevant or obsolete.

The constant and rapid change also means that designers who spend too much time on understanding a design situation and are hesitant to make decisions may end up creating a solution for an outdated problem. Myers, for example, described the problem that constant development of new technologies poses for the design of user interface tools ([Myers et al., 2000](#Myers2000)). They argued that it is difficult to build tools without having significant experience with, and understanding of, the tasks they support. However, the rapid development of new interface technologies and techniques can make it difficult for tools to keep pace. By the time a new user interface implementation task is understood well enough to produce useful tools, the task may have become less critical, or even obsolete.

[^footnote1]: See [http://pages.experts-exchange.com/processing-power-compared/](http://pages.experts-exchange.com/processing-power-compared/) for the effective visualization of the 1 trillion-fold increase in processing power from 1956 to 2015.

A similar note we may find by Harlan Mills, who wrote about difficulties of designing new programming techniques with high-pace of development of hardware ([Glass 2006](#Glass2006)):

*"It's too bad that hardware grew so fast. You know, if we'd had these new processors ... for 50 years at least, mankind could really have learned how to do sequential programming. But the fact is, by the time that [Edsger] Dijkstra comes out with structured programming, we've got all kinds of people using multiprocessors with interrupt handling, and there's no theory behind it, but the IBM's, the DEC's, the CDCs, and so on, they are all driving forward and doing this even though nobody knows how to do it."* (page 241)

The importance of making timely decisions in software design was discussed by [Richardson (2011)](#Richardson2011). He claimed that a software architect could spend a great deal of time designing what he thinks is a perfect system, only to present it when it is irrelevant. To illustrate the challenges of design decisions in a changing environment, Richardson uses an analogy of a hurricane meteorologist:

*“If you give a hurricane meteorologist a giant pile of data about a storm spinning in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and ask her to determine exactly where it will come ashore, she can analyze the data, construct a detailed and accurate model of the atmospheric conditions and weather patterns, run some simulations, and come up with a forecast — two months after the storm hits. It'll probably be wrong, but not by much, a moot point for the people in the storm's path. The problem isn't with the forecast's accuracy but with the time needed to prepare it. … The model favored by hurricane meteorologists is to do just enough data acquisition and analysis to be reasonably certain what the storm will do and then start telling people to get ready.”*

In addition to the high pace of external changes, constant changing of design outcomes may also create internal difficulties for designers. Changeability of software (e.g., see [http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_Software](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_Software), for instance, leads to continually evolving products. This evolution almost always comes with increased volume and internal complexity of such products. At some point, the sheer size and pace of growth of our systems may overpower our ability to understand them. [Ebert and Jones (2009)](#Ebert2009), for example, found out that premium cars in 2009 have 20 to 70 electronic control units with more than 100 million code instructions, totaling close to 1 Gbyte of software. Ebert and Jones also reported that similar embedded systems grow in size 10% to 20% per year. The larger the system, the more significant the number of both, its static elements (the discrete pieces of software, hardware) and its dynamic elements (the couplings and interactions among hardware, software, and users; connections to other systems). The increase of the number of system’s components increases the possibility of errors because at some point no one can completely understand all the interacting parts of the whole or can test them ([Charette 2005](#Charette2005)). Or, as noted by Bob Colwell ([2005](#Colwell2005)) it is always possible to design something too complicated to get it right.

Constant change contributes significantly to the instability of design activities because it forces designers to work without extensive experience with and deep understanding of a design situation. The [*force awakens*](#Boomerang) pattern, for instance, is often a consequence of rapid changes in the external world as a reaction to a design effort, as well as designer's lack of understanding and experience with similar situations. The [*co-evolution of problem-solution*](#CoEvolution) pattern
partially happens because, due to the fast pace of change, designers are dealing with new situations for which there is little previous projects and experiences. On the other hand, the *[fashionable design](#DesignByBuzzword)* pattern, may contribute to the constant change, as it aims at introducing new opportunities that may significantly change design situations.

## B. Increasing Interconnectivity

**Summary**: *Design situations, design outcome, and design resources are increasingly more globally interconnected. Increasing interconnectivity means that there are more ways or channels through which a design activity may be influenced.*


Design situations are never isolated from the outside world. Our competition is closely monitoring the market developments, including our activities, and is reacting to them. Markets are more globalized. Furthermore, events in remote parts of the world, not directly related to design activity, may have a significant impact on it. One extreme example is [the global financial crisis of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308). While started as a consequence of the bursting of the U.S. (United States) housing bubble, the crisis affected almost all countries in the world. The crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of U.S. dollars, and a downturn in economic activity. It led to the Great Recession of 2008–2012 and contributed to the European sovereign-debt crisis. Impact of this global event on design activities has been significant, with many canceled and postponed projects, and budgets changed.

With the increase in the number of globally connected devices and advanced in communication technologies, design outcomes are more and more connected. Many of the current software systems, for example, are globally accessible web applications. Most of the current websites, in addition to being globally available, also offer sharing buttons, connecting their content to social media sites, further increasing their interconnectivity. And with initiative such as Internet-of-Things (IoT), even small devices such as temperature sensors in our houses, can now be connected to a globally accessible network ([Gubbi et al. 2013](#Gubbi2013)). Anticipating behavior of design outcomes in a globally connected network is an increasingly more difficult task.

People themselves are more interconnected. Clients and users are following the news from all around the world, and are continually learning about new technological possibilities, adapting their expectation. Designers are also internationally connected to each other. Design education programs are mostly international. The rise of online education enables learning of new design tools and methods by a broad geographically distributed audience.

Increasing interconnectivity on a global scale may lead to significant changes in short time. Bruce Schneier’s described how one simple message that was naively distributed caused $2.54 billion in market capitalization to disappeared and reappear within just a few hours:

*On August 25, 2000, Internet Wire received a forged email press release seemingly from Emulex Corp., saying that the Emulex CEO had resigned and the company's earnings would be restated. Internet Wire posted the message, without verifying either its origin or contents. Several financial news services and Web sites further distributed the false information, and the stock dropped 61% (from $113 to $43) before the hoax was exposed. This was a devastating network attack. Despite its amateurish execution (the perpetrator, trying to make money on the stock movements, was caught in less than 24 hours), $2.54 billion in market capitalization disappeared, only to reappear hours later.*

Increasing interconnectivity leads to more instability of design activities, as there are more ways or channels through which a design activity may be influenced. The [*force awakens*](#Boomerang) pattern is often a direct consequence of the impact of design outcomes on external, globally connected context. As illustrated by the OLPC project (see the [*force awakens*](#Boomerang) pattern), a project in a rural area in an undeveloped region is not a mere local project. It is also an action in a segment of an emerging market. The *[problematic solution](#ProblematicSolution)* pattern is a consequence of a chain of unforeseen consequences of design outcomes in interconnected environments. Increasing connectivity also means that design professional can quickly learn from each other. The *[conformity](#ResourceConformity)* pattern is in part a result of the ability of design professionals to quickly obtain globally accessible knowledge about some popular design resources. And the *[fashionable design](#DesignByBuzzword)* pattern may lead to successful design outcomes because of the existence of globally connected environments. Global environments enable more people to interact with design outcomes and find novel applications of them.

## C. Learning and Creativity

**Summary**: *Behaviors and expectations of people are continually changing due to their learning and creativity.*

In a design activity, all involved stakeholders are continually learning and discovering new things. Designers learn about new technologies, user wishes, or new design methods, and they may change their designs because of that. Challenging or innovative designs require extensive investigation, experimentation, and iterative improvement based on lessons learned. Fred Brooks even argued that in the design of radically new systems, because of the intensive learning process, designers should plan to throw away the first system that they build. They should then use the gained knowledge to implement the system properly in the next run (Chapter “You won't get it right the first time anyway!”, in [Brook 1995](#Brooks1995)). Moreover, through design, we can learn lessons that are usually difficult to obtain by other means (e.g. [Obrenovic 2011](#Obrenovic2011)).

Clients also learn about new technologies and other designs. And if such learning is extensive, it may lead to significant changes in their perceptions and expectations.

Even the design outcomes are nowadays becoming more intelligent, being able to learn about the environment and the user and to show some form of agency and intelligent behavior ([Holmquist 2017](#Holmquist2017)). The behavior of such systems is dependent on the history of its usage and the context. It becomes challenging to anticipate responses of such systems in all situations. Because of learning and creativity designers do not work with "mechanical" systems that react the same to the same “stimulus.” Rather, because of learning and adaptation, such “systems” may act and react or “behave” differently each time they are approached.

Learning is also related to discovery and creativity. [Boden (2004)](#Boden2004) noted that people expect three elements of any creative contributions: novelty, utility, and surprise. And designers are expected to come up with new and surprising solutions. Schön ([1983](#Schon1983)) used the notion of ‘surprise’ in his theory of creative design. For Schön surprise leads to design situation framing and reframing keeps a designer from routine behavior, and drive the originality streak in a design project. However, as a consequence, creativity and surprise, are also sources of dynamic and arbitrary change – leading to additional instability of design activities.

In addition to designers' creativity, users and clients may use design solutions in unexpected ways. As discussed in the *[solution looking for a problem](#SolutionLookingForProblem)* pattern, people may find new, often surprising usages of design tools and methods.

Learning and creativity lead to constant changing of behaviors and expectations of people. This change contributes significantly to the instability of design activities, and are one of the main sources behind many patterns of dynamics between elements of design activities. The [*co-evolution of problem-solution*](#CoEvolution) pattern is often a consequence of learning and creativity of both designers and their clients (e.g. [Dorst & Cross 2001](#Dorst2001)). As designers engage in design activities, they will discover new things about design situations. As a design outcome begins to emerge, new implications may be discovered. When clients see initial sketches, prototypes, or some version of design outcome, they may discover what they really want, but also learn about new possibilities of used materials and technologies, and as a consequence, they may change their wishes. The *[force awakens](#Boomerang)* pattern is partially a consequence of people outside the design activity learning about the value of the design outcome. This learning may lead them to react in a way that may change our design situation. The *[solution looking for a problem](#SolutionLookingForProblem)* pattern is a consequence of people's creativity in finding new uses for existing solutions. The *[commitment](#ResourceCommitment)* pattern is closely related to learning, as committing to using some design resources facilitates learning and mastering of its usage. The *conformity* pattern is partially a consequence of design professionals being able to quickly learning how to use the same popular design resource. And the *[eating its own dog food](#ResourceCommitment)* pattern is an attempt to stimulate intensive learn within the design company about their designs.

The *[cherry picking](#CherryPicking)* pattern may be viewed as an attempt to avoid risks and costs of extensive learning. In this pattern, designers know limitations of their resources and are applying them only in situations where the resources have proved their value and no surprises are expected.

## D. Tacit Knowledge and Skills

**Summary**: *Designers are relying on tacit knowledge and skills that they do not fully understand and cannot fully explain. Because of its implicit nature, it is hard to predict what effects tacit knowledge will have in design.*

The term “tacit knowing” or “tacit knowledge” was first introduced by Michael Polanyi, with his central assertion being that “*we can know more than we can tell*.” ([Polanyi 1966, page 4](#Polanyi1966)). Polanyi analyzed diverse forms of tacit knowledge, such as tradition, inherited practices, implied values, and prejudgments.

Design is closely related to tacit knowledge. Design aims at exploiting implicit, tacit knowledge and skills of designs and other people involved in the design activity.  Schön [(1987)](#Schon1987) calls such knowledge *knowing-in-action*, revealed only in the way we carry out tasks and approach problems (page 25). Schön elaborated that such knowledge can only be revealed by the skillful execution of the performance. We are characteristically unable to make it verbally explicit. In other words, while we cannot explain such knowledge and skills, we can demonstrate them by being engaged in a particular activity. Cross similarly refers to "natural intelligence" of design ability ([Cross 1999](#Cross1999)), and "designerly ways of knowing" ([Cross 2006](#Cross2006)).

A design activity can set in motion our intuitive and tacit knowledge accumulated through years of research and experience. And by engaging users in design, we may employ their intuitive knowledge about their domains. Much of such valuable knowledge is not captured in existing theories and guidelines. Glass, for example, noted that actions of designers are often implicit and intuitive. He defined intuition as: *“a function of our mind that allows it to access a rich fund of historically gleaned information we are not necessarily aware we possess, by a method we do not understand"* ([Glass, 2006; page 125](#Glass2006)). Glass elaborated that our unawareness of such knowledge does not mean that we cannot use it.

Intuition, judgment and tacit skills play a critical role in understanding and setting problems from messy and ill-defined situations ([Obrenovic 2011](#Obrenovic2011)). Tacit knowledge is often seen as one of the most important characteristics of designers. Moreover, we usually would not call some activity *design* if it does not involve tacit skills ([Weth 1999](#Weth1999)). Tacit knowledge and intuition are often only available intellectual ‘tools’ by which designers can handle real-world complexity.

Tacit knowledge is crucial in design, but because of its implicit nature, it is hard to predict what effects it will have. Consequently, tacit knowledge has a significant influence on the instability of design activities. The [*co-evolution of problem-solution*](#CoEvolution) pattern is often a consequence of actions based on intuition, judgment, and tacit skills. For instance, tacit skills are crucial to identifying design problems, especially in the realm of complex human and social issues. The similar applies to the *[commitment](#ResourceCommitment)* pattern as mastering usage of tools often requires acquiring an extensive set of tacit knowledge and skills.

## E. Social Dynamics

**Summary**: *Design situations, resources, and outcomes are complex socio-technical systems, with complex, difficult to predict dynamics.*

More than 80 years ago, the Hawthorne studies demonstrated that no one interested in the behavior of people could consider them as isolated individuals ([Obrenovic 2014](#Obrenovic2014)). These studies initially aimed at studying the impact of material conditions (e.g., lighting) on the productivity of workers. They discovered that it makes no sense to study the productivity of workers without taking into account factors such as motivational and group influences, social status, informal communication, roles, norms, job satisfaction, resistance to change, group norms, worker participation, and leadership.

Everything that designers do relates to people and their social relations. Every design activity is a field of complex social dynamics. Social dynamics manifests itself through multiple mechanisms, such as culture, values, norms, ethics, peer pressure, charisma, honor, prestige, and so on. Social dynamics affect design activates at all levels. Design situations are complex social contexts, where people and their connection are of primary importance. Design outcomes are never mere material products but always change social dynamics. Sometimes changing the social dynamics may be the primary goal of design activity, such as when we are designing new processes or methods of works in organizations. And design resources are not mere material things, but they come with associated communities of producers, marketers, distributors, practitioners, and education institutions.

Understanding the social context of design is crucial to its success. There are many examples of products that failed due to lack of understanding of the social context. The success of some product in one country or culture does not guarantee its success in another country or culture. Aaron Marcus, for example, discussed that there are significant differences between Western and Asian ways of communicating and interacting and that these differences pervade all aspects of how each group understands daily life and how each group behaves in daily activities ([Marcus 2003](#Marcus2003)).

Clients perception of values and culture of companies and their leaders can have a significant impact on adoption or rejection of designed products. The success of Apple products, for instance, is often associated with the charisma and legacy of Steve Jobs. But there are also negative examples. In 2014, for example, some users boycotted the Firefox Web browser because of the CEO's stance on gay rights. This boycott significantly contributed to the pressure that led to the CEO's resignation ([Obrenovic 2015](#Obrenovic2015)). Similarly, in 2017 The Uber CEO stepped down, due to the pressure caused by negative publicity, such as the #DeleteUber campaign and [the reported incidents of sexual harassment](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber).

Design resources also have their social dynamics. Producers of design resources may use different forms of social activates and pressure to promote usage of their products. Organizing social events, such as sponsored conferences and parties, are all parts of carefully planned promotional activities. Each design resource also has a community behind it, with its own culture. Open-source projects, for instance, have an elaborate and sophisticated network of people working and involved in them [(Bach & Twidale 2010)](#Bach2010). These communities also organize various social events, such as conferences or "meetups," and promote ideas, values and best practices through social networks, blog posts, journals, and books. Such communities also have their thought leaders and influencers. Recommendations of some of the famous and charismatic thought leader may have a stronger impact on design decision than any other factors.

The broader community of the discipline in which designers operate may have a significant impact on their design decisions. Such communities promote specific values and norms, and define what is ethical, acceptable and not acceptable (e.g. [Goodman 2014](#Goodman2014), [Williamson & Sundén 2016](#Williamson2016)).

The structure of design outcomes is also related to social dynamics of teams creating these outcomes. As illustrates by Conway's law ([Conway 1968](#Conway1968)), communication structure of an organization may be relfected in a designed system. And there are a number of reported examples of "technical" problem, that in the end turned out to be a consequence of social issues (e.g. [Matsudaira 2016](#Matsudaira2016), [Kromhout 2018](#Kromhout2018)).

Social factors influence most of the patterns of dynamics of design activities. The [*force awakens*](#Boomerang) pattern is often a consequence of complex social dynamics in society. The *[fashionable design](#DesignByBuzzword)* pattern is in many ways a consequence of social dynamics related to the adoption of new technologies. Popularity and peer pressure may be a strong motivator to buy some new product. And some users see it as a matter of prestige to be among first adopters of some new product. The *[conformity](#ResourceConformity)* pattern may be viewed as a consequence of workings of social mechanisms, such as peer-pressure in the community of designers, popularity and fashion of some design resources. The *[commitment](#ResourceCommitment)* pattern may be influenced by social dynamics related to promotion of some design resource. And the *[your design is your reflection](#ResourceSignature)* pattern, particularly at the organizational level (e.g., Conway's law), is related to social dynamics within design organizations and teams.

## F. Lack of Strong Principles, Theories, and Laws

**Summary**: *Designers are dealing with poorly understood phenomena, for which we do not have strong underlying principles, theories, and laws.*

One common theme about previous sources of design instability is that we are dealing with poorly understood phenomena. Even though there are large numbers of “theories” today about human factors, design processes, and tools, we do not have “strong” theories in the sense that they can be used to prescribe or predict design fully. Learning and creativity, for example, depend on people’s intelligence, previous knowledge and experience, motivation, context, and other factors. Even when studied in more controlled settings, such as in the classroom, learning and creativity are difficult to model. In real-world situations, it is even harder to anticipate how fast and what people will learn, how creative they will be, and how this will affect their behavior.  For example, when introducing a new device, we require people to learn how to use it. This learning process is a function of device design, but other factors, such as peer pressure (e.g., number of friends who have a similar device), can have even more impact on motivation and learning. We do not have enough knowledge to predict or simulate such processes reliably.

Brooks similarly argued that most of the design complexity is arbitrary complexity, not coming from stable underlying principles, but forced, often without apparent reason, by the human institutions and systems to which we must conform ([Brooks 1987](#Brooks1987)):

*“We are not alone in facing complexity. Physics deals with terribly complex objects even at the ‘fundamental’ particle level. The physicist labors on, however, in a firm faith that there are unifying principles to be found, whether in quarks or in unified field theories. Einstein repeatedly argued that there must be simplified explanations of nature ... No such faith comforts the software engineer. Much of the complexity he must master is arbitrary complexity, forced without rhyme or reason by the many human institutions and systems to which his interfaces must conform. These differ from interface to interface, and from time to time, not because of necessity but only because they were designed by different people...”*

Lack of robust theories and underlying principles means that it is not possible to reliably model or predict effects of any design decisions. Designers need to be flexible and to investigate continuously, experiment, and iteratively refine their designs.

The lack of strong theories contributes significantly to the instability of design activities. The *[force awakens](#Boomerang)* and *[problematic solution](#ProblematicSolution)* patterns, for
instance, are partially a consequence of our inability to estimate the impact of our design efforts in a broader context. The [*co-evolution of problem-solution*](#CoEvolution) pattern partially happens due to lack of knowledge and theories about a particular design situation and our inability to develop sufficient understanding of the design situation beforehand.

On the other hand, the *[solution looking for a problem](#SolutionLookingForProblem)* and *[fashionable design](#DesignByBuzzword)* patterns, practically assume that our current understanding and predicted usages of some technology are limited, and that new, unpredicted usages will emerge.
