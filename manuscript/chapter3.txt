# Part III: Sources of Design Complexity

Many factors contribute to instability of design activities. Designers have to make decisions in a limited time based on the imperfect information that they have. They are working in situations that are constantly changing due to forces beyond their control. Designers are using and relying on knowledge and skills that they do not fully understand and cannot explain. And at the same time, they do not have any strong underlying principles, theories and laws to guide them.

In this part we discussion our view of the main reasons behind instability of design activities and complex interactions among design situations, design outcomes and design techniques. We address the following topics:

* The moving target problem,
* Increasing interconnectivity,
* Learning and creativity,
* Reliance on tacit knowledge and skills, and
* Lack of strong theories and principles.

Our main goal is to provide an initial categorization of these topics, and to relate them to the patterns from the previous chapter. Our overview of sources of design instability is not intended to be complete, and proposed classification is not a clear-cut.


## A. The Moving Target Problem

**Summary**: *Design situations change more rapidly than designers’ understanding of them. Consequently, designers need to work without having significant experience with, and understanding of the design situation. Waiting to obtain more experience and better understanding is risky as the issues may quickly become less important or obsolete.*

The world surrounding a design activity is constantly changing. New materials, devices, computers and software products are continuously appearing, introducing new opportunities. Because many of these changes happen rapidly, designers have limited time to create a useful design outcome. Many design outcomes, especially those involving computing technologies[^footnote1], have a limited lifespan, and may quickly become irrelevant or obsolete.

Constant and rapid change also means that designers who spend too much time on understanding a design situation and are hesitant to make decisions may end up creating a solution for an outdated problem. Myers, for example, described the problem that constant development of new technologies poses for design of user interface tools ([Myers et al., 2000](#Myers2000)). He argued that it is difficult to build tools without having significant experience with, and understanding of, the tasks they support. However, the rapid development of new interface technologies and techniques, can make it difficult for tools to keep pace. He elaborated that by the time a new user interface implementation task is understood well enough to produce good tools, the task may have become less important, or even obsolete.

A similar note we may find by Harlan Mills, who wrote about difficulties of designing new programming techniques with high-pace of development of hardware ([Glass 2006](#Glass2006)):

*"It's too bad that hardware grew so fast. You know, if we'd had these new processors ... for 50 years at least, mankind could really have learned how to do sequential programming. But the fact is, by the time that [Edsger] Dijkstra comes out with structured programming, we've got all kinds of people using multiprocessors with interrupt handling, and there's no theory behind it, but the IBM's, the DEC's, the CDCs, and so on, they are all driving forward and doing this even though nobody knows how to do it."* (page 241)

The importance of making timely decisions in software design was discussed by [Richardson (2011)](#Richardson2011). He claimed that an architect can spend a great deal of time designing what he thinks is a perfect system, only to present it when it is irrelevant. To illustrate the challenges of, as well as propose an approach to making software architectural decisions in a changing environment, Richardson uses an analogy of a hurricane meteorologist:

*“If you give a hurricane meteorologist a giant pile of data about a storm spinning in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and ask her to determine exactly where it will come ashore, she can analyze the data, construct a detailed and accurate model of the atmospheric conditions and weather patterns, run some simulations, and come up with a forecast — two months after the storm hits. It'll probably be wrong, but not by much, a moot point for the people in the storm's path. The problem isn't with the forecast's accuracy but with the time needed to prepare it. … The model favored by hurricane meteorologists is to do just enough data acquisition and analysis to be reasonably certain what the storm will do and then start telling people to get ready.”*

In addition to the high pace of external changes, constant changing of design outcomes may also create internal difficulties for designers. Changeability of software (e.g. see [http://sebokwiki
.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_Software](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_Software), for instance, leads to constantly evolving products. This evolution almost always comes with increased
volume and internal complexity of such products. At some point, the sheer volume and pace of growth of our systems may overpower our ability to understand them. [Ebert and Jones (2009)](#Ebert2009), for example, found out that premium cars in 2009 have 20 to 70 electronic control units with more than 100 million code instructions, totaling close to 1 Gbyte of software. Ebert and Jones also reported that similar embedded systems grow in size 10% to 20% per year. The larger the system, the bigger the number of both, its static elements (the discrete pieces of software, hardware) and its dynamic elements (the couplings and interactions among hardware, software, and users; connections to other systems;). The increase of the number of system’s elements increases the possibility of errors, because at some point no one is able to completely understand all the interacting parts of the whole or has the ability to test them [Charette (2005)](# Charette2005).

Constant change contributes significantly to instability of design activities because it forces designers to work without extensive experience with and deep understanding of a design situation. The *boomerang* pattern, for instance, is often a consequence of rapid changes in the external world as a reaction to a design effort, as well as designer's lack of understanding and experience with similar situations. The *co-evolution* pattern partially happens due to designer’s lack of experiences in dealing with the situation. On the other hand, the *opportunistic design* pattern, may contribute to the constant change, as it may introduce new opportunities and needs that may significantly change many design situations.

## B. Increasing Interconnectivity

**Summary**: *Design situations, design outcome and design techniques are increasingly more globally interconnected.*


Design situations are never isolated from the outside world. Our competition is closely monitoring the market developments, including our activities, and is reacting on them. Markets are more globalized. Furthermore, events in remote parts of the world, not directly related to a design activity, may have a significant impact on it. One extreme example is [the global financial crisis of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308). While started as a consequence of the bursting of the U.S. (United States) housing bubble, the crisis affected almost all countries in the world. The crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of U.S. dollars, and a downturn in economic activity. It led to the Great Recession of 2008–2012 and contributed to the European sovereign-debt crisis. Impact of this global event on many design activities has been significant, with many canceled and postponed projects, and budgets being changed.

With increase in the number of globally connected devices and advanced in communication technologies, design outcomes are more and more connected. Many of current software systems, for example, are globally accessible web applications. Most of current web sites, in addition to being globally accessible, also offer sharing buttons, to connect their content to social media sites, further increasing their interconnectivity. And with initiative such as Internet-of-Things (IoT), even small devices such as temperature sensors in our houses, can now be connected to a globally accessible network ([Gubbi et al. 2013](#Gubbi2013)). Anticipating behavior of design outcomes in a globally connected network is increasingly more difficult task.

People themselves are also more interconnected. Clients and users are following the news from all around the world, and are constantly learning about new technology possibilities, adapting their expectation. Designers are also internationally connected to each other. Design education programs are mostly international. Rise of online education enables learning of new design techniques by much broader audience and in many locations.

Increasing interconnectivity on a global scale may lead to significant changes in short time. Bruce Schneier’s described how one simple message, that was naively distributed, caused $2.54 billion in market capitalization to disappeared and reappear within just few hours:

*On August 25, 2000, Internet Wire received a forged email press release seemingly from Emulex Corp., saying that the Emulex CEO had resigned and the company's earnings would be restated. Internet Wire posted the message, without verifying either its origin or contents. Several financial news services and Web sites further distributed the false information, and the stock dropped 61% (from $113 to $43) before the hoax was exposed. This was a devastating network attack. Despite its amateurish execution (the perpetrator, trying to make money on the stock movements, was caught in less than 24 hours), $2.54 billion in market capitalization disappeared, only to reappear hours later.*

Increasing interconnectivity leads to more instability of design activities, as there are more ways or channels through which a design activity may be influenced. The *boomerang* pattern is a direct consequence of impact of design outcomes on external, globally connected context. As illustrated by OLPC project ([see the Section about the Boomerang pattern](#Boomerang)), a project in rural area in an undeveloped region is not a mere local project, but an action in a potentially interesting segment of an emerging global market. The *collateral damage* pattern is a consequence of a chain of unforeseen consequences of design outcome in interconnected environments. The *techniques conformity* pattern is in part a result of ability of design professionals to quickly learn the same globally accessible knowledge about design techniques. Increasing connectivity also means that design professional can quickly learn from each other. And the *opportunistic design* pattern as a possibility of existing solutions to be used in new contexts, may result from the design outcome entering the environment in which there are more people that may try to use design outcome in new situations.

## C. Learning and Creativity

**Summary**: *Behaviors and expectations of people are constantly changing due to continuous learning and creativity of involved people.*

In a design activity, all stakeholders are constantly learning and discovering new things. Designers learn about new technologies, user wishes, or new design methods, and they may change their designs because of that. Challenging or innovative designs require extensive investigation, experimentation, and iterative improvement based on lessons learned. Fred Brooks even argued that in design of radically new systems, because of the intensive learning process, designers should plan to throw away the first system that they build, and use the gained knowledge to implement the system properly in the next run (Chapter “You won't get it right the first time anyway!”, in [Brook 1995](#Brooks1995)). Moreover, through design we can learn unique lessons that are normally difficult to obtain by other means (e.g. [Obrenovic 2011](#Obrenovic2011)).

Clients also learn about new technologies and other designs. And if such learning is extensive, in may lead to significant changes in their perceptions and expectations.

Even the design outcomes are nowadays becoming more intelligent, being able to learn about the environment and the user, and to show some form of agency and intelligent behavior [Holmquist (2017)](#Holmquist2017). The behavior of such systems
than becomes dependent on the history of its usage and the context in which they are used. It becomes extremely difficult to anticipate responses of such systems in all situations. [Norman (2007)](#Norman2007), for instance, argued that extra automation
 in cars could lull the driver into complacency taking over when the going is easy and unexpectedly giving up when things become difficult. Norman describes how one of his friends had a close call after driving for some time at low speed on a congested highway and then turning onto an exit ramp. The car suddenly accelerated because of the adaptive cruise control, which he had forgotten to disable. Learning and creativity means that designers do not work with “systems” that are constant over time and react the same to the same “stimulus”. Rather, because of learning and adaptation, such “systems” may act and react or “behave” differently each time they are approached.

Learning is also related to discovery and creativity. [Boden (2004)](#Boden2004) noted that people expect three elements of any creative contributions: novelty, utility, and surprise. And designers are expected to come up with new and surprising solutions. Schön ([1983](#Schon1983)) used the notion of ‘surprise’ in his theory of creative design. For Schön surprise leads to design situation framing and reframing, keeps a designer from routine behavior, and drive the originality streak in a design project. However, as a consequence, creativity and surprise, are also sources of dynamic and arbitrary change – leading to additional instability of design activities.

In addition to designers' creativity, users and clients may use design solutions in unexpected ways. As discussed in Section “Situation - Process Interaction”, people may find new, often surprising usages for design tools and methods.

Learning and creativity contribute significantly to instability of design activities, and are one of the main sources behind a number of patterns of interactions among elements of design activities. The *co-evolution* pattern is often a consequence of learning and creativity of both designers and their clients (e.g. [Dorst and Cross 2001](#Dorst2001)). As designers engage in design activities they will discover new things about design situations. As design outcome begins to emerge, new implications of design outcomes may be discovered. When clients see initial sketches, prototypes, or some version of design outcome, they may discover what they actually want, but also learn about new possibilities of used materials and technologies, and as a consequence they may change their wishes. The *boomerang* pattern is a consequence of people outside the design activity learning about value of the design outcome. The *solution looking for a problem* pattern is a consequence of learning about possibilities of some design outcome for usage in other situations than originally envisioned. The *technique signature* pattern happens when designers learn how to master their tools. The *technique conformity* pattern is a consequence of many design professionals learning the same popular design techniques. The *good carpenter* pattern is a consequence of good skills in usage of design techniques. The *eating its own dog food* pattern is an attempt to stimulate intensive learn within the design company about some design outcome.

The *cherry picking* pattern may be viewed as an attempt to avoid extensive learning. In this pattern, designers know limitations of their techniques, and are applying them only in situations where they have proved their value and no surprises are expected.


## D. Tacit Knowledge and Skills

**Summary**: *Designers are relying on tacit knowledge and skills that they do not fully understand and cannot fully explain.*

The term “tacit knowing” or “tacit knowledge” was first introduced by Michael Polanyi, with the central assertion being that “*we can know more than we can tell*”. ([Polanyi 1966, page 4](#Polanyi1966)). Polanyi analyzed many forms of tacit knowledge, such as tradition, inherited practices, implied values, and prejudgments. Design is closely related to tacit knowledge. Design aims at exploiting implicit, tacit knowledge and skills of designs and other people involved in the design activity.  [Schön (1987, page 25)](#Schon1987) calls such knowledge *knowing-in-action*, revealed only in the way we carry out tasks and approach problems. Schön elaborated that such knowledge can only be revealed by the skillful execution of the performance, and that we are characteristically unable to make it verbally explicit. In other words, while we cannot explain such knowledge and skills, we can demonstrate them by being engaged in a particular activity. Cross similarly refers to "natural intelligence" of design ability ([Cross 1999](#Cross1999)), and designerly ways of knowing ([Cross 2006](#Cross2006)).

A design activity can set in motion our intuitive and tacit knowledge accumulated through years of research and experience. And by engaging users in design, we may employ their intuitive knowledge about their domains, as well as their creativity. Much of such valuable knowledge is not captured in existing theories and guidelines. Glass, for example, noted that actions of designers are often implicit and intuitive, defining intuition as: *“a function of our mind that allows it to access a rich fund of historically gleaned information we are not necessarily aware we possess, by a method we do not understand"* ([Glass, 2006; page 125](#Glass2006)). Glass further elaborated that our unawareness of such knowledge does not mean that we cannot use it.

“Intuition”, judgment and tacit skills play an important role in understanding and setting problems from messy and ill-defined situations ([Obrenovic 2011](#Obrenovic2011)). Tacit knowledge is often seen as one of the most important characteristics of designers. Moreover, we normally would not call some activity *design* if it can be done without tacit skills ([Weth 1999](#Weth1999)). Tacit knowledge and intuition are, often only available, intellectual ‘tools’ by which designers handle real-world complexity.

Tacit knowledge is crucial in design, but because of its implicit nature, it is hard to predict what effects it will have. Consequently, tacit knowledge has significant influence on instability of design activities. The *co-evolution* pattern is often a consequence of actions based on “intuition”, judgment and tacit skills. For instance, tacit skills are crucial to identify design problems, especially in realm of complex human and social issues. The *solution looking for a problem* pattern is a consequence of people's creativity to develop new uses for existing solutions. The *technique signature* pattern is a consequence of obtaining tacit skills needed to apply some design technique. The similar applies for the *good carpenter pattern* as mastering your tools often requires extensive tacit knowledge and skills.

## E. Lack of Strong Principles, Theories and Laws

**Summary**: *Designers are dealing with poorly understood phenomena, for which we do not have strong underlying principles, theories and laws.*

One of the common themes about previous sources of design instability is that we are dealing with poorly understood phenomena. Even though there are large numbers of “theories” today about human factors, design processes and tools, we do not have “strong” theories in the sense that they can be used to fully prescribe or predict design. Learning and creativity, for example, depend on people’s intelligence, previous knowledge and experience, motivation, context, and many other factors. Even when studies in more controlled settings, such as in the classroom, learning and creativity are difficult to model. In real-world situations, it is even harder to anticipate how fast and what people will learn, how creative they will be, and how this will affect their behavior.  For example, when introducing a new device, we require people to learn how to use it. This learning process is a function of device design, but many other factors, such as peer pressure (e.g. number of friends who have similar devices), can have more serious effects on motivation and learning than the design of device itself. We do not have enough knowledge to reliably predict or simulate such learning process.

Brooks similarly argued that most of the design complexity is arbitrary complexity, not coming from stabile underlying principles, but forced, often without clear reason, by the many human institutions and systems to which we must conform ([Brooks 1987](#Brooks1987)):

*“[W]e are not alone in facing complexity. Physics deals with terribly complex objects even at the ‘fundamental’ particle level. The physicist labors on, however, in a firm faith that there are unifying principles to be found, whether in quarks or in unified field theories. Einstein repeatedly argued that there must be simplified explanations of nature ... No such faith comforts the software engineer. Much of the complexity he must master is arbitrary complexity, forced without rhyme or reason by the many human institutions and systems to which his interfaces must conform. These differ from interface to interface, and from time to time, not because of necessity but only because they were designed by different people...”*

Lack of strong theories and underlying principles means that it is not possible to reliably model or predict effects of any design decisions. Designers need to be flexible, and to continuously investigate, experiment, and iteratively refine their designs.

The lack of strong theories contributes significantly to instability of design activities. *Boomerang* and *collateral damage* patterns, for instance, are partially a consequence of our inability to estimate the impact of our design efforts in a broader context. The *co-evolution* pattern partially happens as consequence of our inability to develop sufficient understanding of the design situation beforehand. On the other hand, the *opportunistic design* pattern, practically assumes that currently predicted usages of some design outcome are limited, and new unpredicted usages will emerge.
