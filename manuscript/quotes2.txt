| "The importance of changing the mindset in relation to the new support paradigm implied by **open-source software** (OSS) is also significant. By and large, reliance on a standard maintenance contract isn't an option, and bulletin boards might be the main source of support. Thus, it is hardly surprising that support from top management is critical. Also, even though OSS may be available at little or no cost, organizations should not expect maintenance and support to be available at a lesser cost than would apply for commercial software. Indeed, OSS represents a good opportunity for small software companies all around the world to treat it as **an infrastructure component**, like the highway or telecommunications lines, and then use it as a bootstrap to build a service and support business model on top." |
