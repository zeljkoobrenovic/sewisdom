"Many of the **challenges facing the software industry** today are a direct result of our **insatiable appetite for new** computer-based systems applications. Others confront us simply because we have not managed to successfully solve a large number of **problems that we ourselves created many years ago**."

"Designing a computer system is very **different from designing an algorithm**: ... the requirement - is less precisely defined more complex, and more subject to change; the system has much more internal structure - hence, many internal interfaces; and the measure of success is much less clear. The designer usually finds himself flondering in a sea of possibilities, unclear about how one choice will limit his freedom to take other choices or affect the size and performance of the entire-system."

"Booch offers a software design methodology, which he calls "**object-oriented design**" in contrast to earlier popular methods he designates as either **functional** or **data-oriented**. In contrast to
suggestions that we either identify a program's principal function and describe it in the top box in a hierarchy chart or carefully identify the patterns of data and their flows, Booch suggests, 'Define the problem, develop an informal strategy; formalize the strategy.'"

"The use of **formal notation** does not, however, preclude that of **natural language**. In fact, mathematical specification  of a problem usually leads to a  better natural-language description. This is because formal notations naturally lead the specifier to **raise

"In essence, **programming-in-the large** involves the two complementary activities of modularization and interface control. **Modularization** is the identification of the major system modules and the entities those modules
contain, where entities are language elements that are given names, such as
subprograms, data objects, and types. **Interface control** is the specification
and control of the interactions among entities in different modules."

Each reactor has two independent shutdown systems: SDS1 drops neutron-absorbing rods into the core, while SDS2 injects liquid poison into the moderator.

"**The 4+1 View Model** describes software architecture using **five concurrent views** ... : The **logical view** describes the design's object model, the **process view** describes the design's concurrency and synchronization aspects; the **physical view** describes the mapping of the software onto the hardware and shows the system's distributed aspects, and the **development view** describes the software's static organization in the development environment. Software designers can organize the description of their **architectural decisions** around these four views and then illustrate them with a few selected use cases, or **scenarios**, which constitute **a fifth view**.

"**Domain-specific modeling** (DSM) languages have been adopted in many industries, but these languages haven't yet gained wide acceptance in practice. This is because the claims of increased productivity and ease of understanding haven't been verified by independent studies. To address this concern, this article compares the maintenance performance of the Enterprise Mobile Application DSM (EMADSM) language and UML. Maintenance in software-intensive systems is critical because software often continuously evolves not only during development but also after delivery, to meet users' ever-changing needs. So, maintenance performance significantly impacts software development productivity. Study results show that maintenance is significantly easier and faster with EMADSM than with UML. This finding has considerable implications for companies that maintain evolving systems."

"Railroad tracks offer guidance and support. There are various tools that can give our software the same handling. The main tool for guiding the code's direction is the **language's type system**. For values, the type system can help us by establishing a separate type for each distinct class; for code, interfaces and abstract classes ensure that we won't forget some crucial methods when we add functionality through a new class. With **domain-specific languages** or even suitably initialized data structures we can efficiently express exactly what the designer intended and nothing more. At a higher level, **architectures** that enforce a particular open-ended but well-defined interface will also guide a software's progress. Finally, the most flexible track-laying approach is a **tool-supported** software development process."

"There comes **a point of no return** in the life of every successful software-intensive system, a point where you can no longer place a pile of your best developers at one end of a lever and expect them to move the world. Rather, you must come to realize that **putting piles of developers** at the end of even the longest lever is no longer the right tool to use. Crossing that point while still preserving the values and the **tribal memory** of your organization's development culture requires some serious adult supervision."

"'What is **Infrastructure as code**? There are a lot of ways to answer that. One is that automation is the “CALM” of DevOps. CALM stands for **culture, automation, learning, and measurement**. Infrastructure as Code is about the automation piece. That's how people who have been doing DevOps for a while approach it, using tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack. The philosophy behind this is that infrastructure has become like data: the physical layer has been abstracted. It's **become software**, as opposed to being a physical thing. We can use infrastructure tools the same way we use software. We can **bring in best practices from software development**, such as continuous integration CI, test-driven development, and continuous delivery CD version control systems, and apply them to managing our infrastructure.

"**Mission-critical Internet of Things (MC-IoT)** systems involve heterogeneous things from both the **digital and physical worlds**. They run applications whose failure might cause significant and possibly **dramatic consequences**, such as interruption of public services, significant business losses, and deterioration of enterprise operations. These applications require not only high **availability**, **reliability**, **safety**, and **security** but also **regulatory compliance**, **scalability**, and **serviceability**. At the same time, they're exposed to various facets of uncertainty, spanning from software and hardware variability to mission planning and execution in possibly unforeseeable environments. **Model-driven engineering** can potentially meet these challenges and better enable the adoption of MC-IoT systems."

"The **Internet of Things (IoT) **is a challenging combination of **distribution and heterogeneity**. A number of software engineering solutions address those challenges in isolation, but few solutions tackle them in combination, which poses a set of concrete challenges. The **ThingML** (Internet of Things Modeling Language) approach attempts to address those challenges."

"No consolidated set of software engineering **best practices** for the **Internet of Things (IoT)** has yet emerged. Too often, the landscape resembles **the Wild West**, with unprepared programmers putting together IoT systems in ad hoc fashion and throwing them out into the market, often poorly tested. In addition, the academic sector is in danger of fragmenting into specialized, often unrelated research areas."
