# Part I: Introduction


Designers deal with an overwhelmingly rich reality, undetermined requirements, intricate social situations, lack of information, lack of resources and with time constraints. Every designer[^fooDesigner] is faced and challenged by the complexity resulting from interaction of all these and many other factors. But while many agree that design activities are complex, discussing complexity in design is difficult, as complexity is a very loaded and often vaguely defined term.

With this book, we want to better describe and give a structured definition of what design complexity may mean. We believe that such more structured overview can help researchers and practitioners to better understand some of the experiences designers are going through while designing. We also believe that in the education of designers it is useful to picture design complexity as an essential part of design. Design complexity has to be accepted and dealt with, and not treated as a problem to avoid. We believe that a more structured understanding of design complexity can facilitate such education.

A central thesis explored in this book is that complexity characteristic for design activities emerges from an inherent *instability of design activities*. We will argue that this instability is a
 consequence of messy, dynamic, highly interdependent and mostly unpredictable dynamics between design situations, design outcomes, and design resources[^fooTerminology].

In our discussions of design complexity, we address design in a broader sense, in line with the Herbert Simon's ([1996](#Simon1996)) definition of design as courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. Due to our personal backgrounds and interests, however, we limit our overview and examples, to some degree, to discussions about complexity in software and interaction design. In particular we are biased towards those contributions that base their claims in observations of design practice (e.g. [Brooks 1995](#Brooks1995); [Glass 2006](#Glass2006)). However, we also provide some connections to more general design theory (e.g. [Schön 1983](#Schon1983); [Lawson 2005](#Lawson2005); [Simon 1996](#Simon1996)).

## A. Analyzing Design Complexity: A Simple Model

Our goal is to provide a novel view on why it is challenging to analyze, understand or explain the design process and design activities. We want to investigate why design is by many seen as difficult and complex.

To structure our discussion, we adopt a simple analytic model. This model focuses on the analysis of complexity of design activities as a consequence of interactions among design situations, design outcomes and design resources. Our analytic model views complexity of design activities as originating from the designers’ difficulties to:

* understand and manage design situations (design problems),
* create and understand design outcomes (design solutions), and
* understand and properly use design resources (tools, methodologies, procedures, and organizational structures supporting designers during a design activity).

![Our analytic model for design complexity: Design situations, design outcomes, design resources and relations among them.](images/Model.png)

While the complexity of individual elements of design activities, such as intrinsic complexity of design outcomes (systems) has been addressed by previous work (e.g. Simon 1996), complex and dynamic interdependencies of these elements have received relatively little attention. With this book, we focus on these interdependencies, as we believe that they are main sources of complexity characteristic for design activities. In other words, while design situations, outcomes and resources are themselves complex structures, what makes a design activity additionally and characteristically complex are interactions among these structures. These interactions challenge designers' ability to deal with complexity as these structures are unstable and subject to change in difficult to predict ways.

In next part of our book we will use our analytic model to structure the description of the patterns of dynamics among design situations, outcomes and resources.

It is important to remember that elements in our model are abstract analytical concepts. In reality, these elements are not clearly separated. Nevertheless, the concepts of design situations, outcomes and resources are regularly used in design literature, and we believe that they help in structuring discussions on design complexity.


## B. Why This Book?

Our ambition is to provide a novel and more structured view on complexity in design. We do not aim at introducing a new theory about design complexity, nor are the topics we discuss completely new (e.g. [Stolterman 2008](#Stolterman2008a)). Rather, we are re-examining existing work on design complexity from a new and partially different point of view. We are also bringing together some related but previously unconnected pieces of literature on design complexity.

Design complexity has been recognized, examined and to some degree theoretically analyzed[^complexityReferences]. However, design complexity is still an under-researched area. With this book, we want to further investigate it. Furthermore, while design is universally seen as a complex activity, many design writers discuss complexity in design only as a passing comment in writings focused on other themes. Robert Glass, for example, discusses complexity of software design at several places in his book related to software creativity ([Glass 2006](#Glass2006)). Fred Brooks similarly do this in his book on general software engineering and project management topics ([Brooks 1995](#Brooks1995)).

We have found many similarities in works of authors from different domains. But we also noticed that many of the authors do not reference the authors outside of their field of study. We believe that there is a value in connecting the contributions from different fields. By creating such connections, we hope to create a better overview for design practitioners and researchers interested to further study this subject.

## C. What is Complexity?

Before we start, it is important to briefly examine our view on the notion of "complexity", as it is a very broad and loaded term[^complexityScience].

Our view on complexity is based on Herbert Simon's definition of a complex system as *“one made up of a large number of parts that interact in a non-simple way"* ([Simon 1996](#Simon1996), page 183). While this is a very broad and vague definition, for our purposes it is worth noting that this definition emphasizes the importance of looking at complexity from two sides:

* a structural, more quantitative, objective and measurable side, which reflects the number and organization of the elements of the objects that we see as complex,
* a cognitive, qualitative, more subjective side, which reflects the challenges of human cognition to understand and manage such complex objects.

It is hard and probably meaningless to talk about complexity without talking about both of these sides. Structural and cognitive elements of complexity are interrelated, but not necessary in an
obvious way. For example, the number of elements of an object and the number of relations among these elements has a direct influence on our ability to perceive, understand and manage the object.
However, various representation techniques, such as visual groupings, can significantly improve our ability to understand such objects, without actually changing the number of elements and their relations. For that reason, a diagram is (sometimes) worth ten thousand words ([Larkin & Simon 1987](#Larkin1987)). In *[The Sciences of the Artificial](#Simon1996)*, Herbert Simon discussed extensively the role of representation in human’s understanding and perception of complexity. Simon argued that sometimes the main discovery is a change in representation, such as mathematical derivations: *"all mathematical derivation can be viewed simply as change in representation, making evident what was previously true but obscure."* ([Simon 1996, page 77](#Simon1996)).

In line with the previous discussion, we view design situations, outcomes and resources as complex, non-trivial, and interconnected structures. In our discussions, we explore key factors that challenge designers' ability to understand and manage these structures. In particular, we focus on factors related to dynamic relations among design situations, outcomes and resources. Dynamics of these relations challenge designers' ability to deal with complexity as any of the structures is subject to change, in difficult to predict ways. And with our [analytic model](#Model) and [pattern language](#Patterns) we aim at creating the representation that can facilitate reasoning about these dynamics, hopefully making more evident what was previously true but obscure.


[^complexityScience]: The term "complexity" is also often associated with “[complexity science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_theory)”, which covers a broad range of topics including complexity theory and organizations, complexity economics, complex adaptive system, and computational complexity theory ([Neil 2007](#Neil2007)). It is important to note that in this book we do not cover topics from this more scientific and mathematical perspective.

## D. The Structure of the Book

The rest of this book is organized as follows.

In Part II, we address design complexity as a consequence of inherent instability of design activities. We describe this instability with patterns of dynamics between elements of a design activity. We argue that the instability of design activities is emerging from complex and not fully known interactions among the elements of design activities. With a number of examples, we illustrate that dynamics between design situations, design outcomes and design resources are diverse and bidirectional.

In Part III we discuss sources of interactions among the elements of design activity. We address the moving target problem, learning, creativity, tacit knowledge, social dynamics, as well as the lack of strong theories and underlying principles. Here we also discuss how are these aspects related to the patterns of dynamics between elements of design activities.

We conclude the book with a general discussion.


## E. About the Cover

The cover shows an [extratropical cyclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone) near Iceland on September 4, 2003. We selected this image as it symbolizes the central concept of this book - the instability of design activities. A cyclone is a complex, dynamic, and partially unpredictable phenomenon. Still, as with design instability, it is not a completely chaotic phenomenon, as some patterns are visible.


[^fooDesigner]: In this book, we use the notion of designer to mean anyone involved in a professional design process. In many cases a design process involves more than one designer.

[^fooTerminology]: We user more generic terms *design situations* / *design outcomes* instead of *design problems* / *design solutions* because we do not view design as a simple problem-solving activity. We define a design resource in a broader sense, as tools, processes, and organizational structures designers rely on during a design activity.
