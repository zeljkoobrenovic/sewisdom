# Part I: Introduction

Designers deal with an overwhelmingly rich reality, undetermined requirements, highly intricate social situations, lack of information, as well as lack of resource and time restrictions. Every designer[^fooDesigner] is faced and challenged by this complexity. Discussing complexity in design, however, is difficult, as complexity is a very loaded and often vaguely defined term.

With this book, we want to better describe and give a structured definition of what design complexity may mean. We believe that such more structured overview can help researchers and practitioners to better understand some of the experiences they are going through while designing. We also believe that in the education of designers it is useful to picture design complexity as an essential part of design that has to be accepted and dealt with, and not as a problem to avoid. We believe that a more structured understanding of design complexity can make such education possible.

A central thesis explored in this book is that complexity characteristic for design activities emerges from an inherent *instability of design activities*. We will argue that this instability is a consequence of messy, dynamic, highly interdependent and unpredictable interactions between design situations, design outcomes, and design resources[^fooTerminology]. Design situations, design outcomes and design resources are complex structures that are not independent of each other. They are also continuously changing, in great part due to forces that are beyond designers' control.

In our discussions of design complexity, we address design in broader sense, in line with the ([Herbert Simon's](#Simon1996)) definition of design as courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. Due to our personal backgrounds and interests, however, we limit our overview and examples, to some degree, to discussions about complexity in software and interaction design. In particular we are biased towards those contributions that base their claims in observations of design practice (e.g. [Brooks 1995](#Brooks1995); [Glass 2006](#Glass2006)). However, we also provide some connections to more general design theory (e.g. [Schön 1983](#Schon1983); [Lawson 2005](#Lawson2005); [Simon 1996](#Simon1996)).

## A. What is Complexity?

Before we start, it is important to examine our view on the notion of "complexity", as it is a very broad and loaded term. In most work on design complexity, definitions are tied to or based on the concept of a "system". Such definitions postulate or assume that complexity expresses a condition of numerous elements in a system and relationships among the elements. Herbert Simon, for example, defined a complex system as *“one made up of a large number of parts that interact in a non-simple way"*, where *"the whole is more than the sum of the parts"* ([Simon 1996](#Simon1996), page 183). [Hendler et al. (2008)](#Hendler2008) also noted that complex systems have emergent properties that are not predictable by analyzing micro technical and/or social effects. Definitions of complex systems often emphasize that the number of parts in the system and the number of relations between the parts would have to be non-trivial. However, there does not seem to exist any general rule that could help us to separate "trivial" from "non-trivial" ([Neil 2007](#Neil2007)).

Looking at standard dictionaries we can find similar definitions, where complexity is being defined in relation to the terms complex and/or complicated. For example, [complex](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/complex) is commonly defined as (1) composed of two or more parts: composite, or (2) hard to separate, analyze, or solve. [Complicated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/complicated) is commonly defined as (1) consisting of parts intricately combined (2) difficult to analyze, understand, or explain.

While there are many other definitions of complexity, and subtle differences between the terms complex and complicated, for our discussion it is important to note that complexity is almost always defined as having two sides:

* a structural, more quantitative, objective and measurable side, which reflects the organization of the elements of the object that we see as complex,
* a cognitive, qualitative, more subjective side, which reflects the human capability to understand complex objects and to cope with complexity.

It is hard and probably meaningless to talk about complexity without talking about both of these sides. Structural and cognitive elements of complexity are of course interrelated, but not necessary in an obvious way. For example, the number of elements of an object and the number of dependencies and relations among these objects has a direct influence on our ability to perceptive, understand and manage such objects. However, various techniques, such as visual groupings, can significantly improve our ability to understand such objects, without actually changing the number of elements and their interrelations. [Simon (1996)](#Simon1996), for example, discussed extensively the role of representation in human’s understanding and perception of complexity. He argued that sometimes the main discovery is a change in representation, such as mathematical derivations: *"[a]ll mathematical derivation can be viewed simply as change in representation, making evident what was previously true but obscure."* ([Simon 1996, page 77](#Simon1996)). For similar reasons, a diagram is (sometimes) worth ten thousand words ([Larkin & Simon 1987](#Larkin1987)).

Another aspect of the structural-cognitive division of complexity stems from the fact that our cognitive abilities are not independent of the structure of the object we are dealing with. Many studies from the domain of embodied intelligence have shown the importance and formative role that environment plays in our cognition (e.g. [Hutchins 1995](#Hutchins1995); [Clark 2008](#Clark2008)).

The object of analysis when it comes to design complexity must therefore include both cognition and structure, at least if the purpose is to develop a complete understanding of the phenomena. In other words, many of our cognitive skills are developed in interaction with objects and environments, and we cannot understand them without taking into account the context where such cognition takes place, and the objects with which humans interact.

The term "complexity" is often associated with “complexity science”, which deals with a quite specific scientific usage of the term complexity. It is important to note that we do not aim at covering the meaning of complexity from this more scientific perspective. Instead we will explore and examine design complexity as a form of “complex circumstances”, that is, we take a quite commonsense and practical approach to the notion. We are trying to stay close to the more everyday way of experiencing and understanding complexity that might be found among designers.


## B. Analyzing Design Complexity with a Simple Model

Our goal is to provide a novel view on why it is challenging to analyze, understand or explain the design process and design activities. We want to investigate why design is by many seen as difficult and complex. For these purposes, we adopt a simple analytic model. This model focuses on the analysis of complexity of design activities as a consequence of interactions among the elements design situations, design outcomes and design resources. We are fully aware that our model is not comprehensive and does simplify the process of design into very crude and abstract elements, however, we believe that this is a necessary consequence of our aim to create and overview understanding that is both graspable and hopefully useful.

Our analytic model views complexity of design activities as originating from the designers’ difficulty to:

* understand and manage design situations (design problems),
* create and understand design outcomes (design solutions), and
* understand, master and use design resources (design methodologies, procedures and tools).

![Our Analytic Model for Design Complexity: Design situations, design outcomes, design resources and relations among them.](images/Model.png)

Each of these elements can, of course, individually have a seriously complex structure. Designers are dealing with highly complex social, psychological and technological issues. With the highly developed technology, cultural diversity, and economically and socially intricate society we are facing today, final design outcomes seems to be getting more and more complex. Given this richness and complexity, it is in many cases impossible for one single individual to completely understand all aspects of the design. The design process has developed to include many individuals, teams, all with special skills and competences. At the same time, the design process is becoming increasingly complex due to the use of advanced and constantly changing tools and methodologies. Each of these tools and methodologies is supposed to make the design process easier (and to reduce complexity in some way). But because of their number and constant development, they seem to add to the complexity of the design process.

While the complexity of individual elements of design activities, such as intrinsic complexity of design outcomes (e.g. systems) has been addressed by previous work (e.g. Simon 1996), complex, dynamic interdependencies of these elements has received relatively little attention. We focus on this later aspect as we believe that these interdependencies are main sources of complexity characteristic for design activities. In other words, while design situations, outcomes and resources are themselves complex structures, what makes a design activity additionally and characteristically complex are interactions among these structures. These interactions challenge designers' ability to deal with complexity as any of these structure is subject to change, and this change is difficult to predict.

It is important to remember that elements in our model are abstract analytical concepts. In reality, these elements are not clearly separated. Nevertheless, these concepts are regularly used in design literature, and we believe that they help in structuring discussions on design complexity.


## C. Relation to Previous Work

Our ambition is to provide a novel and more structured view on complexity in design. We do not claim that we are introducing a new theory about design complexity, nor that the topics we discuss are completely new (e.g. [Stolterman 2008](#Stolterman2008a)). Rather, we are re-examining existing work on design complexity from a new and partially different point of view. We are also bringing together some related but previously unconnected pieces of literature on design complexity. Design complexity has been recognized, examined and to some degree theoretically analyzed (e.g. [Simon 1996](#Simon1996); [Buchanan 1992](#Buchanan1992); [Schön 1983](#Schon1983); [Janlert & Stolterman 2008](#Janlert2008); [Nelson & Stolterman 2012](#Nelson2012), [Booch 2005](#Booch2005), [Mens 2012](#Mens2012)). However, design complexity is still an under-researched area. With this book, we want to further investigate it. Furthermore, while design is universally seen as a complex activity, many design writers discuss complexity in design only in a passing comment in writings focused on other themes. Robert Glass, for example, discusses complexity of software design at several places in his book related to software creativity ([Glass 2006](#Glass2006)). Fred Brooks similarly do this in his book related to general software engineering and project management ([Brooks 1995](#Brooks1995)). While we have found many similarities in works of different authors, these authors often do not reference other design authors that discuss similar issues. We believe that by connecting these diverse contributions, we can create a better overview for design practitioners and researchers interested to further study this subject.


## D. The Structure of the Book

The rest of this book is organized as follows.

In Part II, we address design complexity as a consequence of inherent instability of design activities. We describe this instability with patterns of interactions among elements of a design activity. We discuss that the instability design is emerging from complex and not fully known interactions among the elements of design activities. With a number of examples, we illustrate that relations among design situations, design outcomes and design resources are diverse and bidirectional.

In Part III we discuss sources of interactions among the elements of design activity. We address learning, creativity, tacit knowledge, the lack of strong underlying principles, as well as the moving target problem. Here we also discuss how are these aspects related to the patterns of interactions among elements of design activities.

We conclude the book with a general discussion.


## E. About the Cover

The cover shows the [Tropical Cyclone Gafilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Gafilo) approaching Madagascar on March 6, 2004. We selected this image for cover as a symbol of the central concept of this book - the instability of design activities. The cyclone is a complex, dynamic, and partially unpredictable phenomena. Still, as with design instability, it is not a completely chaotic phenomena, as patterns are clearly visible.


[^fooDesigner]: In this book, we use the notion of designer to mean anyone involved in a professional design process. In many cases a design process involves more than one designer.

[^fooTerminology]: We user more generic terms *design situations* / *design outcomes* instead of *design problems* / *design solutions* because we do not view design as a simple problem-solving activity. We define a design resource in a broader sense, as tools, processes, and organizational structures designers rely on during a design activity.
